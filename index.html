            <p class="aboutp">My name is Vincent Caracciolo. I was born and raised in NY but moved to Richmond, Virginia in January to
                live a more
                affordable lifestyle with my partner. New York City is the greatest city in the world however, it's very
                expensive. Virginia's cost of living has allowed us to rent our own apartment and even adopt our own dog
                Nacho! Nacho is a Golden Retriever/Shepherd mix and is very cute and friendly. He's a good dogo but has
                noise anxiety and doesn't sit well during storms or fireworks.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">I graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Fine Arts at Hunter College
                in NYC but would like to branch my creativity into the tech industry. Coding is an exciting oppurtunity
                for me to push the limits of my creativity and expand my art background to
                digital layouts and designs. Iâ€™m currently a server but will be undergoing bar training soon. It will be
                fun to make drinks behind
                the bar and not have to deal with guests at tables.</p>
